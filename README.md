# FinalProj
This is a machine learning final project conducted by Benjamin Mauldin in R for MGT 665 at Northwood University, under the tutelage of Dr. Folami Alamudun. It consists of the R code, in the form of both an rmd and html file, a voice-over presentation, and a short paper. Student exam pass/fail data was obtained from kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/code/muzammilbaloch/student-exam-performance-analysis-prediction. Logistic Regression and Random Forest methods were applied to the student data to classify students into passing or failing categories, and then tested on the provided test data to high predictive success.
